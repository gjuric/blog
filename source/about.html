      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>My name is Goran JuriÄ‡. I am a Software Architect/Engineer currently living in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
      <p>My main expertise is application development in PHP. Lately, most of my projects are based on Symfony 2 PHP framework and Doctrine 2 <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</abbr>. I am also interested in other technologies that make developers life easier (<a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/">unit testing</a>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">continuous integration</a>, <a href="http://www.phing.info">build tools</a>, <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">automatic deployment</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">key-value stores</a>, etc.).</p>
      <p>I love to play around with system administration and know my way around <a href="https://www.powerdns.com/">DNS</a>, <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">email</a> and PHP application stack on Linux. <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is my distribution of choice.</p>
      <p>I strongly believe in good documentation that captures and saves the time you invested in gaining the knowledge. You can check some of my tutorials on my <a href="http://gogs.info/wiki/">wiki</a> and a <a href="http://gogs.info/books/debian-mail/">book on building an email server on Debian</a>.</p>
      <p>Currently I am self employed, doing consulting and programming jobs for clients across the globe.</p>
