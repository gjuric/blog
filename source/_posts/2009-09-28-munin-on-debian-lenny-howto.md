I have been playing with an excellent monitoring tool [Munin][1]. Since I had some glitches while trying to install it on my server a have decided to update [my Wiki][2] a little bit and add a tutorial about [setting up Munin on Debian Lenny][3]. It is quite late and I do not feel like proofreading this entry right now so you will have to forgive me if I forgot something.
