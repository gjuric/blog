Zend Framework project is about to start working on the 2.0 version. If you are using ZF in your projects, but you are not interested in contributing ideas to the project by joining the zf-contributors mailing list, the least you could do is provide feedback about your ZF experience by answering a [survey][1].

You can find more info at the [devzone][2].
