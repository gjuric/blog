One of the things that bugged me the most after switching to Mac on my job was an inability to use the Tab key to move across all of the elements in a form. Using the Tab key after a fresh install of your Mac will move you over the text input fields only.

Since a have reinstalled my computer with a fresh copy of Snow Leopard couple of weeks ago I found myself browsing through the System preferences looking for the same option again.

So, as a future reminder for myself you have to press the Ctrl + F7, or open up System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts and select &#8220;All controls&#8221; in the bottom of your screen.
