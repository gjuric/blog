If you have tried using the the [TinyMCE spell check plugin][1] on UTF-8 encoded page with the PSpellShell adapter you probably noticed that the implementation is broken. The spelling suggestions do not contain properly encoded UTF-8 characters.

Since the creators of TinyMCE moved to [Github][2] it was a great opportunity to try and push these changes to the master branch. If you need this you can look at the [changes that need to be made to the PSpellShell adapter][3] or just clone my [fork of the spellcheck plugin][4].

p.s. Have I mentioned how awesome Git and Github are?
